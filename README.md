# NameChanger
A little script that helps change the names of the pictures downloaded from an iphone,  useful script for those who like to catalog the images by Creation Date without using Exif data
# How to use it
download the last script in the directory where you want to change the names, then run the script, it will create a directory "convertito" with inside all the pictures with the changed names
# Future work
